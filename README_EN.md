**leanclr4unity** is the **Unity integration package** for [LeanCLR](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr/blob/main/README.md).

This repository (package name `com.code-philosophy.leanclr`) is responsible for Unity Editor-side integration, build pipeline wiring, and release workflows. The **LeanCLR runtime** itself is maintained in a separate repository: [LeanCLR](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr).

## Why LeanCLR for Unity

LeanCLR is a lightweight, cross-platform implementation of CLR (Common Language Runtime). Its core goal is to provide a runtime that remains highly compliant with ECMA-335 while being more compact, easier to embed, and lower in memory footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained targets such as mobile, H5, and mini-game platforms. When publishing Unity projects to WebGL or mini-game platforms, IL2CPP often introduces large wasm outputs and high memory overhead. Replacing IL2CPP with LeanCLR can significantly reduce post-build wasm size and lower both metadata and managed-memory costs.

For a complete background, comparisons with CoreCLR / Mono / IL2CPP, roadmap, and module progress, see the **[LeanCLR README](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr/blob/main/README.md)**.

## Documentation

### Supported Unity versions and platforms

- Unity Editor on Windows is currently supported. macOS and Linux support will be added in future releases.
- Supports all Unity versions from Unity 2021 to Unity 6000 (including both LTS and non-LTS releases).
- Supports all versions of Tuanjie Engine.
- Supports WebGL and MiniGame platforms.
- Other platforms (for example, Win64) are partially supported, but only in single-thread mode. Manual edits to generated platform build project files **may** be required. For example, when publishing Win64 on Unity 6000, remove IL2CPP command-line argument `--static-lib-il2-cpp` from `Il2CppOutputProject.vcxproj`; otherwise startup may fail with `il2cpp init failed`.

### Limitations

Because this is still an early version, some capabilities are not fully implemented yet.

- **GC is not supported yet**, but planned for an upcoming release.
- Single-thread execution only.
- Only P/Invoke functions introduced by `mscorlib` and Unity engine DLLs are supported. P/Invoke functions defined in user assemblies are not supported.

### Sample project

- [leanclr4unity_demo](https://github.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr4unity_demo)

### Installation

In Unity Package Manager, click `Add package from git URL...`, then use either of the following:

- `https://github.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr4unity.git`
- `https://gitee.com/focus-creative-games/leanclr4unity.git`

### Settings

Open the project settings page via **`LeanCLR/Settings...`** (or **Edit > Project Settings > LeanCLR**). Settings are stored in **`ProjectSettings/LeanCLR.asset`** and are saved automatically when you leave the settings UI.

#### Main toggle

- **`enable`**: Turns LeanCLR integration on or off. When off, builds do not use this package’s IL2CPP / LeanCLR pipeline.

#### Lean AOT (`leanAOTSettings`)

Options for **Lean AOT (leanaot)** during packaging. If you leave the nested object unset, built-in defaults apply (layout validation off, no rule files).

- **`layoutValidation`**: Enables layout-related checks to catch inconsistencies with native layouts earlier; turn on mainly for diagnostics or stricter validation workflows.
- **`ruleFiles`**: Configures the list of **AOT rule file** paths (multiple entries allowed). For rule file format, elements, and semantics, see **[`Docs~/aot-rule-file.md`](./Docs~/aot-rule-file.md)** in this package. Each path may be relative to the **Unity project root** (the folder that contains `Assets`) or an absolute path on disk. Missing files fail the build at preprocess time. Leave the list empty or unset to skip external rule files.

### Build

No manual action is required. During release builds, this plugin automatically uses LeanCLR to replace IL2CPP.
